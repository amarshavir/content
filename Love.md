Love is a river that flows so deep,
A feeling that we just can't keep.
It washes away our fears and doubts,
Filling our hearts with joyous shouts.

Love is a rose that blooms so bright,
A symbol of beauty in the night.
Its petals soft, its scent so sweet,
It brings a smile to every street.

Love is a fire that burns so warm,
A passion that keeps us from harm.
It shines like a star, bright and bold,
A treasure worth having, worth its weight in gold.

Love is a promise that we make,
A commitment to never let it break.
It's what we hold on to, when we're feeling low,
A love that will continue to grow.

So let us cherish this love we've found,
A bond that will always be unbound.
For love is a gift that we give,
A light that will always help us live.
