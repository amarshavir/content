Always, the sun rises in the east,
Bringing light to the world, with its warm embrace.
A new day begins, full of hope and cheer,
A promise of good things, to come throughout the year.

Always, the stars twinkle in the night,
A guiding light, shining ever so bright.
They show us the way, and light up our dreams,
With hope for the future, and memories to keep.

Always, the waves crash against the shore,
A rhythm of life, that we've heard before.
The ebb and flow, a reminder to be strong,
That we'll weather the storms, and carry on.

Always, the wind whispers in the trees,
Telling secrets and stories, with gentle ease.
A reminder that life is a journey untold,
And we are the keepers of the stories we hold.

So let us always hold on to hope,
And cherish the moments, as they help us cope.
For life is a journey, always worth the while,
And the memories we make, will always bring a smile.
