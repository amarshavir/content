Title = "Ardent"
+++

Ardent, like a flame that burns bright,
A passion that cannot be tamed or put to flight.
A fire in the soul, that never fades away,
A love that grows stronger, with each passing day.

Ardent, like a summer sun, so warm and bright,
A heat that brings life, to everything in sight.
A comfort that spreads, like a gentle embrace,
A love that sustains us, in life's busiest race.

Ardent, like a storm that rages on,
A force of nature, that can never be undone.
A power that drives us, to be all we can be,
A passion that burns within, so wild and free.

Ardent, like a heart that beats with love,
A feeling that never fades, or fades away above.
A force that drives us, to be all we can be,
A love that endures, for all eternity.
