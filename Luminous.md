Title = "Luminous"
+++

Luminous, like a star in the sky,
A light that shines bright, never to die.
A beacon of hope, that guides us through the night,
A symbol of strength, that makes everything all right.

Luminous, like a ray of sunshine,
A warmth that spreads, making everything just fine.
A comfort that brings, a smile to our face,
A light that dispels, all of life's dark place.

Luminous, like a flame that burns bright,
A fire that illuminates, everything in sight.
A passion that drives, us to be our best,
A light that helps us, stand out from the rest.

Luminous, like a diamond so rare,
A treasure that sparkles, beyond compare.
A beauty that shines, with an inner light,
A luminance that never, fades from sight.

So let us be luminous, like the stars in the sky,
A light that shines bright, never to die.
For we have a purpose, and a mission to fulfill,
To be a luminous light, that brings happiness and thrill.
