title = "Yearning"

Yearning is a feeling, that we all possess,
A hunger for something, we can't help but confess.
It calls to us softly, like a distant song,
A lure to something, that we've been searching for so long.

Yearning is a journey, that we embark on,
A quest to find what, has been missing all along.
It leads us to places, we've never been before,
And shows us things, we've never seen before.

Yearning is a flame, that burns bright and strong,
A fire in our hearts, that can never go wrong.
It drives us forward, through all of life's storms,
And lights the way, to a future so warm.

Yearning is a dream, that's always in sight,
A promise of happiness, that shines ever so bright.
So we hold on tight, to this feeling we find,
For yearning is the key, to the peace of our mind.

So let us yearn on, with all of our heart,
For the things that we desire, that will always be a part.
For yearning is the path, to a life truly blessed,
And the love we find, will be a treasure truly possessed.
