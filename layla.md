title = "Valentine"

In a world that's always spinning,
Where the days just come and go,
I'm searching for a *[Love](/love)* worth winning,
A flame that will *[Always](/always)* glow.

I've walked the path of heartbreak,
And felt the sting of pain,
But I keep moving forward, for love's sake,
*[Yearning](/yearning)* to find it again.

I look for it in laughter,
In the way the stars align,
In the joy that follows after,
And the moments that are divine.

I search for it in nature,
In the calm of a summer breeze,
And in the beat of my heart's measure,
That's where I hope to find my peace.

Beyond the horizon, where the sky meets the sea,
Lies a world of wonder, that's waiting for me.
Where the sun rises slow, and sets with a sigh,
And the stars twinkle bright, against the midnight sky.

The wind whispers secrets, to the leaves on the trees,
And the waves sing a song, to the rhythm of the breeze.
Where the mountains reach high, and the rivers flow low,
And the world keeps turning, in an endless show.

There's a magic in the air, that can't be denied,
And a beauty in the world, that fills me with pride.
Where the flowers bloom *[Luminous](/luminous)*, and the birds sing sweet,
And the world keeps spinning, beneath my feet.

So I'll wander and I'll roam, and I'll follow my dreams,
Through the valleys and the hills, and the babbling streams.
And I'll soak up the sun, and I'll breathe in the air,
And I'll know that I'm home, beyond the horizon, out there.


So I'll keep searching, high and low,
With an *[Ardent](/ardent)* heart and an open mind,
For the love that will continue to grow,
And the one who'll make me whole, *[I'll find](https://youtu.be/A8ZZbxTxoq8)*.
