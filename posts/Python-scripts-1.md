## A while ago
during my first year of comp sci, I was tasked to create a game of tik tac toe. While not a complex procedure, I decided to make it more complicated for myself. In challenging my younger self, I went through 3 development phases.

### The base game
I do not have the files for the base game; if I find the Replit file, I will make sure to fill this section of the story. Until then, my dear reader, you can use your wonderful imagination.


### Adding "Features."
the more complicated procedure that I eluded to before was adding variable board sizing. This dynamic board sizing was an exercise in mental gymnastics.

The full code file:


    def main():
    import os
    global b
    def cls():
        os.system('cls' if os.name=='nt' else 'clear')

    b = int(input("how big do you want the board: "))

    col_sto = []
    ls_turn = []
    players = ['x','o']
    board = []
    turn_count = 0
    for x in range(0, b):
        for x in range(0, b):
            board.append("-")
    game_active = True
    while game_active == True:
        test = int(input(":")) - 1
        ls_turn.append(test)
        while len(ls_turn) != len(set(ls_turn)):
            ls_turn = list(dict.fromkeys(ls_turn))
            test = int(input(" :"))-1
            ls_turn.append(test)
        board[test] = players[0]

        global ls
        ls = [board[x:x + b] for x in range(0, len(board), b)]
        test_ls = [board[x:x + b] for x in range(0, len(board), b)]

        def display():
            for i in ls:
                print(i)
        cls()
        display()

        def end_game():
            global game_active
            wld = input("would you like to play again[y/n]: ")
            if wld == "y":
            main()
            else: 
            quit()

                    #print("All elements in list are equal")
                    winner = ls[0][0]

                    if winner == 'x' or 'o':
                        return winner
