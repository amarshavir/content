Verily, at times when the rain falls, when the clouds darken, and when the light seems to fade, it is hard to recall a moment before. How quickly despair falls upon the hearts of men, how easily we forget the brightest day when the darkest night transforms the world into a great void. I still remember when death became real, or at least real to me.

The shadows emerged from the fallen sun, the morningstar. Cast out of heaven and cursed into the depths of hell. As the morningstar's light turned black, and the skies turned to grey, the souls of man forgot the once brightest days for then began the blackest night.

"This is the last day of morality, Isaac, dost thou see those people over there? Behold their shadows," my brother said. The shadows cast from the villagers in the town began to absorb their hosts. I always found my older brother's sentiment to be perplexing. The shadows were the devils in the hearts of men, nothing more than the physical constructs created by the deviance of every man, woman, and child. Morals were born from the gift of mortality from the Father. A social contract for the people to follow to improve the lives of others and subsequently themselves. Or at least to the highest extent in which desert life could be improved. My brother's words indicated, at some level, that a mortal heart by default is immoral.

"We must go, Isaac, for Father hath warned us of these days. Make haste."

"What is happening? Where are we supposed to go, brother?"

"To the desert, for Father said when the morningstar falls, we must find the philosopher's stone."

"Falling stars? A stone? How are those two things related?"

"I will explain on our journey. Take this," Abraham tossed a shortened Lancea at me. "Hopefully thou wilt not be forced to use it, but in the night, anything goes."

Our first shadow appeared, a man unlike any I had ever seen before. Its skin was a sickly shade of green, its eyes glowing yellow in the darkness. Its limbs were elongated and thin, each ending in razor-sharp claws. A monster of pure lust, a shadow whose soul shall rest in the first circle of the abyss. It let out a blood-curdling scream that echoed across the land, and we knew we had to run. Abraham and I ran as fast as we could, our hearts pounding with fear. We could hear the creature's footsteps behind us, getting closer with each passing moment. Suddenly, Abraham stopped in his tracks and turned to face the monster.

"Isaac, go! Keep running!" he shouted.

I hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to do. But then I saw the determination in my brother's eyes, and I knew he would not let that creature harm us. I turned and ran, tears streaming down my face as I heard the sounds of battle behind me.

When I finally stopped to catch my breath, I realized I was alone. The darkness enveloped me, and I was filled with despair. Abraham was not with me. My brother was so strong. If only I was more like him.

For the past twelve days, Abraham has been able to fight off the shadows of lust and gluttony on his own. After all, he says, "They are weak spirits, nothing more than those with a self-destructive craving. Their own desires bring them to ruin. They are the trespassers of self." My brother has not allowed me to eat since our first night.

"We are going to die out here, brother."

"Isaac, thou must stay steadfast, for Father is watching over us."

"If thou sayest so, but who is that man over there?"

"IT WILL BE MINE, IT WILL BE ALL MINE, GIVE IT TO ME"


Verily, the answer to my question was revealed unto me, and it was but a shadow of greed. Greed, unlike the desires we had encountered thus far, sought to take from others. It was a trespass against mankind.

"I canst assist in this fight, for I have learned much from observing thee battle the other Shadows," I declared.

"As much as I detest admitting it, I believe thy aid may be required," responded Abraham.

And so, Abraham and Isaac stood before the Shadow of Greed, a creature unlike any they had encountered before, with eyes that glimmered with an insatiable hunger. The Shadow moved swiftly, lunging forward with its claws aimed towards Abraham's throat.

I sprang into action, wielding my lance at the ready. I charged towards the Shadow, catching it off guard. However, the Shadow proved to be too strong, knocking my lance out of my hand and sending me flying backwards. Abraham stood alone against the creature, his own lance gleaming in the moonlight. He moved with a grace that was almost otherworldly, evading the Shadow's attacks and striking back with deadly precision. As the battle raged on, I watched in awe. Abraham was like a force of nature, his willpower unbreakable.

In the end, it was Abraham who emerged victorious. He plunged his lance deep into the Shadow's chest, and the creature let out a final, anguished scream before dissolving into silver coins. I rushed to my brother's side, overflowing with gratitude and awe. "How didst thou accomplish such a feat, Abraham?" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. Abraham smiled wearily. "It was but a trifling matter, my dear Isaac," he said. "Just a small amount of training, and a great deal of determination."

I knew that my brother was being modest. Abraham's strength and courage were beyond measure, and he had just proven himself to be a true warrior of the desert.

As we continued our journey through the wilderness, I knew that we still had a long way to go before we found the philosopher's stone, but I was no longer afraid. With my brother by my side, I was invincible.

For forty days and forty nights, my brother and I fought through hell. Through lust, through greed, anger and violence. Night after night, our hunger grew in parallel with our strength. Abraham never allowed me to destroy one of the Shadows. "Thou must preserve thy innocence, my dear brother," Abraham told me.

"Behold, there it is—the philosopher's stone," I exclaimed.

It was a small and unremarkable object, yet it held within it the power to rid the world of its shadows. Abraham and I gazed at it in wonder, knowing that it would change our lives forever.

"So thou hast come for the philosopher's stone," spoke a voice from the darkness. We turned to see a figure shrouded in darkness, its eyes glowing red in the dim light. "Who art thou?" Abraham asked.

"I am the collective of the stone," the figure replied. "The power thou dost desire requires sacrifice—an equivalent exchange."

"What sacrifice?" I asked, my voice trembling.

"By now, thou hast become acquainted with my siblings—the Shadows, the sins, the deviations. I am unlike the other Shadows; I am treachery. I am an immortal Shadow, and I shall always exist, but I require souls for strength."

"Brother, what art thou doing, Abraham? I beg of thee, answer me," I pleaded.

"To end this madness, one of us must fall; I cannot allow thee to perish, my dear brother," replied Abraham.

"Give me the lance, Isaac," Abraham commanded.



As the stone glowed with a bright red light, the world around us began to change. The shadows that once plagued the land began to fade away, replaced by a warm and gentle light. The air filled with the sounds of birds singing and the scent of fresh flowers blooming.

I looked at the stone in my hand, still in disbelief at what had just happened. My brother, my mentor, and my friend, had given his life for this. I knew that I would never forget the sacrifice he had made.

From that day on, I traveled the world, using the power of the philosopher's stone to help those in need. I helped heal the sick, fed the hungry, and brought hope to the hopeless. I knew that I could never replace Abraham, but I would do my best to carry on his legacy.

Years passed, and I grew old, but the power of the stone remained with me. As I approached the end of my life, I knew that it was time for me to pass on the stone to someone else. I searched high and low for someone worthy of the responsibility, but no one seemed to fit the bill.

Then one day, as I sat by a river, I saw a young boy playing by the water's edge. He was kind and gentle, and I could see the goodness in his heart. I knew that he was the one.

"Come here, child," I said, holding out the stone. "This is the philosopher's stone, and it holds within it the power to change the world. I am giving it to you, and I trust that you will use it wisely."

The boy took the stone, his eyes wide with wonder. "I will use it to make the world a better place," he said.

And with those words, I knew that I had made the right choice. I closed my eyes, content in the knowledge that the world was in good hands.

  
  

  
  

Verily, in the brightest of days,

Tyranny doth set a blazing craze,

And in the blackest of nights,

The loss of light doth bring frightful plights.

  

When shadows cast and mortals fast,

Night shall return to day at last,

And sinners shall find the way,

In the brightest of days.

  

Yet if the crimes of man do stand,

Salvation withers, like grains of sand,

Devastation shall be unleashed upon the land,

A display of nature's might in the blackest of nights.

  

The creation of mortals is grand,

But destruction doth come at their own command,

For their own hands bring about their plight,

In the brightest of days and the blackest of nights.

  

Let us, therefore, strive for humility and light,

And cast away the shadows of night,

For in the end, our choices shall decide,

Whether we shall abide in pride or in darkness reside.
