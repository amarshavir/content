## Introduction

Roughtly 6 months ago I started on a journey. A journy of epic sword fights, great victories, and even greater _losses_

For some context, my school has a partakes in a state wide extracorical program [STLP]("https://stlp.education.ky.gov/")
The Program itself is a massive science fair/club, you can read more about it in the link above


### The plan
_Was_ simple, make an app that is helpful to the student population
The Idea _Was_ to make an app for mental help, the goal _was_ a Therapy app that students could download on to their phone or access using our web page.
Seems simple enough, 

## How hard could making an app be?
At this point in time, ive made dozens of websites by now. I could even through in some new tricks instead of using a [REST]("https://restfulapi.net/") API, maybe Tryout [Graphql]("https://graphql.org/"). A high preformance API that I can _easily_ set up using a fast web framework.  The framework, why none other than microsoft's [ASP.NET]("https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/aspnet/what-is-aspnet-core") 

A lighting fast utility kit prefect for the web. Last, all I need was a database for all my trash .... I mean very useful information and a cross platfrom lib for making my app in a record time of 6 months. My Weapons of choice [MySQL]("https://www.mysql.com/") and [Flutter]("https://flutter.dev/")

## The problems

### Graph QL
Some people would describe Graphql as cool, hip, swag, or some other mid 2000s slang. I however am _not_ one of those people, my experience with graphql would best be described as _spirtually taxing_. 

I understand the need/want of graphql, it is very atttactive from a techinal standpoint, this however did not aid me whatsoever in the many wasted hours I spent across multiple frameworks and languages.

### The bane of my existence
ASP.NET IS __TRASH__.

Quite possibly the worst mistake I have ever made, programming for the last 3 years, is ever trying to get this garbage to work in a cohesive manner. I can not count to the nearst 10 thousand how many times I have just asked "why" regarding this framework or whatever Microsoft calls it

## The not problems

### The GOAT maybe, IDK
[Flutter]("https://flutter.dev/") IS __AMAZING__

The original design for my app took like 2 days. The widgets are easy to use and understand. Setting up colors was a breeze. The only actual issue that I ever had with flutter is the dynamic rendering from a from the web server, and sockets.

My Next app I will most likely use [React Native]("https://reactnative.dev/"), then compare the two dev experiences that I have had and declare one as the GOAT
