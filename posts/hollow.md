## Introduction

RoughlyRoughtly six months ago, I started on a journey. A journey journeyjourneyjourny of epic sword fights, great victories, and even more significant _losses_

For some context, my school partakes in a statewide program [STLP]("https://stlp.education.ky.gov/")
The Program itself is a massive science fair/club; you can read more about it in the link above


### The plan
It was simple, make an app that is helpful to the student population
The Idea _Was_ to make an app for mental help; the goal _was_ a Therapy app that students could download on their phones or access using our web page.
It seems simple enough, 

## How hard could making an app be?
At this point, I've made dozens of websites by now. I could see even through some new tricks instead of using a [REST]("https://restfulapi.net/") API, maybe Tryout [Graphql]("https://graphql.org/"). A high-performance API that I can _easily_ set up using a fast web framework.  The framework, why none other than Microsoft's [ASP.NET]("https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/aspnet/what-is-aspnet-core") 

A lighting-fast utility kit perfect for the web. Last, all I needed was a database for all my trash... I mean beneficial information and a cross-platform lib for making my app in a record time of 6 months. My Weapons of choice are [MySQL]("https://www.mysql.com/") and [Flutter]("https://flutter.dev/").

## The problems

### Graph QL
Some people would describe Graphql as cool, hip, swag, or some other mid-2000s slang. I, however, am _not_ one of those people; my experience with graphql would best be described as spiritually taxing_. 

I understand the need/want of graphql; it is desirable from a technical standpoint. However, this could have helped me in the many wasted hours I spent across multiple frameworks and languages.

### The bane of my existence
ASP.NET IS __TRASH__.

The worst mistake I have ever made programming for the last three years is trying to get this garbage to work cohesively. I can not count to the nearest 10 thousand how many times I have just asked "why" regarding this framework or whatever Microsoft calls it.

## The not problems

### The GOAT, maybe, IDK
[Flutter]("https://flutter.dev/") IS __AMAZING__

The original design for my app took like two days. The widgets are easy to use and understand. Setting up colors was a breeze. The only actual issue I ever had with flutter was the dynamic rendering from the web server and sockets.

For my next app, I will most likely use [React Native]("https://reactnative.dev/"), then compare the two dev experiences I have had and declare one as the GOAT.
